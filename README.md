# Code style guide
Guidelines on coding for the NY Daily News newsroom

## Religious battles

### Spaces vs. tabs

Spaces, four of them.

### CamelCase vs. underscore_each_word

Underscores, please. The one exception: When naming Python classes, use CamelCase.

## Other naming conventions

### File and directory names
Naming files and directories consistently will make certain things in your world a little bit easier.

Some basics:
* All names should be lower-case, always.
* Use hyphens in directories, use underscores in file names. Never use spaces.
* Keep directory names for directories that store assets as short as can be while still being clear.
* Image file names should be as clear as possible. If the image is a photo, make sure you can tell what the photo is of from the file name.

### Variable names

#### Constant names

Constants act like a variable but once a constant is set it doesn't change. Often these are used as environment vars used to configure a particular app on a particular server / computer.

Constant names should be UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

### What about when I'm importing code that uses its own style?

Let it be.

## HTML style

## Javascript style

## CSS style

## Python style

[PEP8 is the Python style guide and is worth reading](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
